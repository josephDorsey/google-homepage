# google-homepage

Hello! This is my first mini-project. I am required to deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

Made a couple of changes to html and css. First I added classes to the top buttons in the header div. Next, I changed the footer div to have a bottom of 0 to bring the nav bar to the bottom and gave it a colored background.

Also changed the value and type of the search and feeling lucky buttons. Now I need to fix their sizes and work on adding a line over the footer. Also attempting to add a box shadow on hover for the search bar.

Was able to fix the Google Search and Feeling lucky buttons, by changing their height and width and as well as adjusting their margin-left property. Fixed the issue with the border around the Google Search and Feeling lucky buttons, deleted the :hover code to it.

I still plan on working on the middle-content, but if there's time I will also work on the footer:

    -rounding out the search bar
    -adding a shadow element to the hover function of the search bar
    -how to put the magnifying glass and the input voice in the search bar
