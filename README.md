Hello! This is my first mini-project. I am required to deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

Made a couple of changes to html and css. First I added classes to the top buttons in the header div. Next, I changed the footer div to have a bottom of 0 to bring the nav bar to the bottom and gave it a colored background.

Also changed the value and type of the search and feeling lucky buttons. Now I need to fix their sizes and work on adding a line over the footer. Also attempting to add a box shadow on hover for the search bar.
